Indeed, any distribution $p\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)$ that is nonzero at each of the data points $\\mathbf{x}_1,\\dots, \\mathbf{x}_N$ is a potentioal candidate. The issue of choosing an approriate distribution relates to the problem of model selection and that is a central issue in pattern recognition."

    "We begin by considering the binomial and multinomial distributions for discrete random variables and the Gaussian distribution for continuous random variables. These are specific examples of parametric distributions, so-called because they are governed by a small number of adaptive parameters, such as the mean and variance in the the case of a Gaussian for example. To apply such models to the problem of density estimation, we need a procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters, given an observed data set. In a frequentist treatment, we choose specific values for the parameters by optimizing some criterion, such as the likelihood function. By contrast, in a Bayesian treatment we introduce prior distributions over the parameters and then use Bayes' theorem to compute the corresponding posterior distribution given the observed data."

For example, the conjugate prior for the parameters of the multinomial distribution is called the Dirichlet distribution, while the conjugate prior for the mean of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. All of these distributions are examples of the exponential family of distributions, which possess a number of important properties."

    "One limitation of the parametric approach is that it assumes a specific functional form for the distribution, which may turn out to inappropriate for a particular application. An alternamtive approach is given by nonparametric density estimation methods in which the form of the distribution typically depends on the size of the data set. Such models still contain parameters, but these control the model complexity rather than the from of the distribution. We end this chapter by considering three nonparametric methods based respectively on histograms, nearest-neighbours, and kernels."

    "One of the difficulties with the kernel approach to density estimation is that the parameter $h$ governing the kernel width is fixed for all kernels. In regions of high data density, a large value of $h$ may lead to over-smoothing and a washing out of structure that might otherwise be extracted from the data. However, reducing $h$ may lead to noisy estimates elesewhere in data space where the density is smaller. Thus the optimal choice for $h$ may be dependent on location within the data space. This issue is addressed by nearest-neighbour methods for density estimation."

To do this, we consider a small sphere centred on the point $\\mathbf{x}$ at which we wish to estimate the density $p\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)$, and we allow the radius of the sphere to grow until it contains precisely $K$ data points. The estimate of the density $p\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\right)$ is then given by (2.246) with $V$ set to the volume of the resulting sphere. This technique is known as $K$ nearest neighbours. We see that the value of $K$ now governs the degree of smoothing and that again there is an optimum choice for $K$ that is neither too large nor too small."

    "As discussed so far, both the K-nearest-neighbour method, and the kernel density estimator, require the entire training data set to be stored, leading to expensive computation if the data set is large. This effect can be offset, at the expense of some additional one-off computation, by constructing tree-based search structures to allow (approximate) near neighbours to be found efficiently without doing an exhaustive search of the data set. Nevertheless, these nonparametric methods are still severely limited. On the other hand, we have seen that simple parametric models are very restricted in terms of the forms of distribution that they can represent. We therefore need to find density models that are very flexible and yet for which the complexity of the models can be controlled independently of the size of the training set, and we shall see in subsequent chapters how to achieve this."
